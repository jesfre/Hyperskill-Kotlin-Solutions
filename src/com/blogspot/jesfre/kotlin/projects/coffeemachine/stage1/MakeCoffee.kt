Description
Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee â€“ virtual coffee, of course.
But in this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine.
It can run out of milk, it can run out of coffee beans, it can make different varieties of coffee,
and it can take the money for making a coffee.

The first version of the program just makes you a coffee.
It prints to the standard output what it is doing as it makes a coffee.
