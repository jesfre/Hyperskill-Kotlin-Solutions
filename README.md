# Hyperskill Kotlin Solutions
Solutions to the Code Challenge problems in the JetBrains Academy - Hyperskill Kotlin tutorial.

To solve the problems I used the Kotlin Playground https://play.kotlinlang.org which has basic intelli-sense and a nice code color theme,
but after some sections of the tutorial I decided to use the IntelliJ IDEA Community edition instead to better organize the code and other capabilities.
